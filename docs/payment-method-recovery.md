# Payment-method recovery verification

## Behavior and boundaries

An actual default payment-method change on `customer.updated` or
`customer.subscription.updated` emits `payment_method_updated`. Attaching a card
alone is not a selection. Events include the customer/subscription/invoice join
IDs, scope, and subscription status, but no card IDs, card numbers, or user content.
Count distinct affected users or subscriptions when measuring recovery; a customer
update can also produce a subscription update, so raw event counts are not unique
card updates.

For an eligible delinquent subscription, synchronize its overriding payment method
and attempt payment of its latest open automatic renewal invoice. Customer and
subscription deliveries share the invoice-payment idempotency key. Default-card
updates use selection-event-scoped keys so selecting a previous card again cannot
reuse an old update response. Declines/authentication
requirements remain pending; operational errors fail webhook delivery for retry.
Only the existing `invoice.paid` handler can restore access. No old, canceled,
scheduled-for-cancellation, paused, manual, written-off, upgrade, initial-payment,
paid, stale-invoice, or in-progress-payment case is collected by this helper.
Healthy subscriptions' defaults are not rewritten.

Before a customer event replaces a different subscription default, inspect Stripe's
subscription-update event history since that customer event. A newer card selection
or an ambiguous same-second selection preserves the subscription override. The
scan is bounded to 1,000 events and skips collection if history is incomplete or
the customer event is older than Stripe's 30-day retention. API lookup failures
retry webhook delivery. Restricted Stripe keys need Events read permission.

## Pricing and Account recovery

A failed payment-history lookup keeps recovery controls and the checkout block
available, but the copy states that billing status could not be verified rather
than asserting an unpaid invoice. Explicit status checks fetch fresh data before
updating the pricing cache or clearing a checkout review warning.

Pricing checks authenticated billing status before enabling paid plan changes.
Delinquent renewals display a persistent recovery panel with the actual invoice
balance, card update, and a payment-status recheck. Pay invoice is offered only
when the invoice belongs to the current customer's uncanceled automatic renewal;
the server repeats those checks and retrieves a fresh hosted payment URL at click
time. Opening that URL does not charge an invoice or restore access.

Former subscribers retain payment management in Account settings after dropping
to Free. An unresolved canceled renewal uses the existing checkout safety guard
and shows billing help instead of invoice payment: paying an old invoice does not
restart a canceled subscription. Card management remains independent of that
review. Status lookup failures stay unknown and offer retry instead of enabling a
new checkout. Card-update returns request an entitlement refresh; payment status
and access still require successful payment and the ordinary admission checks.

## Blocked-chat recovery

Blocked Ask/Agent errors, saved budget stops, and exhausted composer warnings
check the authenticated billing status before rendering usage-purchase actions.
Normal chat traffic and near-limit warnings do not make this Stripe lookup.
Concurrent notices deduplicate by user and organization; focus and reconnect
revalidate without interval polling. Billing failures remain unknown rather than
being interpreted as exhausted usage. Multiple current subscriptions or a truncated
subscription list require billing review; neither surface chooses the first
subscription as a recovery target. Non-admins are directed to their billing
administrator; portal creation keeps the existing server authorization checks.

Only a current delinquent subscription with an open automatic renewal invoice
qualifies for the direct Update payment action. Scheduled cancellations and
paused collection remain outside automatic recovery. The portal returns to the
same chat with an entitlement refresh request. Neither opening the portal nor
returning from it starts a chat or grants access; users refresh after payment and
retry through the normal server admission checks. A declined or
authentication-required replacement remains pending until payment succeeds.

## Payments received after cancellation

Paying an old invoice cannot reactivate a canceled Stripe subscription. A renewal
paid after cancellation for `payment_failed` is refunded automatically only when
it is the subscription's latest automatic renewal invoice, with one fully paid
PaymentIntent allocation and a matching, undisputed, fully captured charge.
The handler checks current Stripe state before refunding. A replacement
subscription, credit note, support resolution, partial payment, or unrelated
refund requires manual reconciliation. Payments made before cancellation and
voluntary cancellations are outside this policy.

On `customer.subscription.deleted` with reason `payment_failed`, the handler
voids the latest wholly unpaid automatic renewal for a single recognized,
licensed individual plan, with exactly one invoice line matching that subscription
item and a quantity of one. Both `open` and `uncollectible` invoices can still be
paid, so both are eligible. This deliberately retires that failed renewal debt
instead of collecting money for a subscription that cannot be restarted. It
does not grant access or usage; the customer starts a new subscription normally.
Team, metered, unfamiliar, partial-payment, prior-debt, proration, mixed-item, credit-note,
and support-adjusted cases remain for review. Pending payment processing or
authentication also prevents cleanup. Cleanup failures retry the deletion
webhook before it is marked processed. Cleanup runs even if customer-user lookup
fails or finds no users. A concurrent paid invoice stays under
the existing late-payment reconciliation policy.

This prevents future eligible canceled renewals from leaving a payable old
invoice link or blocking a fresh checkout. It does not backfill already processed
cancellations or change how an existing ambiguous paid invoice is resolved.

An in-app cancellation of a `past_due` or `unpaid` subscription ends service
immediately. The cancellation path voids its latest open automatic renewal
invoice only when nothing has been paid and every line is a non-prorated
subscription item. Stripe can settle an invoice while cancellation is running;
the subscribe route checks recent canceled renewals before creating another
Checkout session. An open invoice or a payment around cancellation returns a
409 for support reconciliation instead of risking a second charge. A voided
invoice allows a new checkout. For paid invoices, a fully settled refund or a
documented support resolution also allows checkout. Open or uncollectible
invoices remain blocked until voided, even if they have a support note, because
they can still be paid. Pending or partial refunds still require review. This
guard does not itself refund a settled payment.

Refund creation uses an invoice/charge idempotency key and durable refund metadata
for retries after Stripe's idempotency cache expires. API failures retry webhook
delivery. Pending refunds stay pending; failed, canceled, or action-required refund
updates raise `billing_late_payment_requires_manual_reconciliation`. Monitor this
event alongside `billing_late_payment_reconciled`. A refund records offsetting cash
revenue without restored access, recovered MRR, referral eligibility, or fresh
usage credits. This change handles new webhook deliveries; it does not backfill
previously processed payments.

For a manual replacement month, first coordinate with any in-flight webhook and
confirm no refund has been issued. Mark the original invoice's metadata
`hackeraiLatePaymentResolution` with the chosen resolution before granting service,
and retain the invoice reference on the replacement subscription. Recheck refunds
afterward. A zero-dollar trial invoice does **not** refresh a previously frozen
usage bucket: verify Stripe/WorkOS entitlements and restore the customer's monthly
allowance separately against the verified production Redis database, preserving
extra-usage balances and using the new subscription's period end. Verify a bounded
chat after the customer refreshes their entitlement session.

## Release requirements

1. Verify the intended account, deployment, custom domain, and environment before
   any configuration or deployment. Never connect a Stripe sandbox to production
   user data. Preview uses the designated HackerAI Developer Convex deployment and
   PostHog project `401167`; production uses the designated HackerAI Convex
   deployment and PostHog project `144137`.
2. Deploy the additive Convex schema/mutation change before the application handler:
   it accepts `customer.subscription.updated` as a lifecycle event.
3. On the subscription webhook destination, enable `customer.updated` while
   preserving `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`,
   `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated`,
   `customer.subscription.deleted`, `refund.created`, and `refund.updated`.
   Read back the target URL and the complete event list. Do not add
   `payment_method.attached` for recovery analytics.
4. Deploy the app and complete the sandbox journey below before claiming the
   production recovery behavior is verified. Existing tests mock Stripe, Convex,
   WorkOS, and access state; they are not a substitute for this journey.
5. The late-payment refund path needs Invoice Payments read and Refunds read/write
   access. Verify successful `refund.created` and `refund.updated` deliveries,
   including when the Charge object has no legacy `invoice` field. Cancellation
   cleanup additionally requires Invoices write and PaymentIntents read access;
   verify the restricted webhook key supports `invoices.voidInvoice`.

## Manual sandbox journey (required)

Use a disposable test user, organization, and Stripe sandbox customer. Verify all
credentials and endpoints select the same test environment without printing secrets.
Do not use a real customer's card or `scripts/attach-failing-card.ts` (that script
detaches existing methods and has no sandbox guard).

1. Purchase a test subscription and confirm paid access. Make an automatic renewal
   fail using Stripe's documented test payment methods/test clock. Preserve an old
   failing subscription-level default. Verify `invoice.payment_failed`, delinquent
   status, and the corresponding access hold.
2. From HackerAI's billing recovery entry point, open the customer portal and select
   a successful test card. Confirm `payment_update_opened` followed by
   `payment_method_updated` for that test identity in Preview PostHog.
3. Read back the customer's default and subscription's default: both must select
   the replacement card. Verify the latest renewal invoice actually reaches
   `paid` with a successful Stripe payment, not just a successful card attachment.
4. Verify `invoice.paid` delivery succeeds, the subscription returns to an eligible
   paid state, and `billing_payment_recovered` is emitted. Reload HackerAI, submit
   a bounded test chat, and confirm it completes through the formerly held access
   path. Card selection alone must never restore access.
5. Replay the same customer/subscription/invoice deliveries: no second successful
   payment, no extra access reset, and no duplicate event for the same insert ID.
6. Repeat with a declining/authentication-required replacement. The account remains
   pending until actual payment succeeds; card-update telemetry still appears.
   Complete authentication through Stripe's payment flow, then verify recovery.
7. Select customer card A, then subscription card B; deliver customer A's event
   last. Verify B remains selected and A is not charged. Repeat with same-second
   timestamps, where the subscription override is conservatively preserved.
8. Check an attachment-only event, a stale default-card event, and a canceled
   subscription: none initiates collection. Remove disposable test artifacts only
   after recording sanitized outcomes and confirming their exact IDs.
9. In a separate sandbox case, let renewal failures cancel an individual licensed
   subscription. Confirm deletion delivery voids its latest unpaid renewal
   (`open` and `uncollectible` cases), the old hosted invoice cannot accept payment,
   and a fresh checkout is allowed. Replay deletion: no additional write, access,
   usage, or charge. Make the void API fail once: delivery must retry and complete
   cleanup, rather than acknowledge and strand the invoice. Repeat with a partial
   payment, credit note, mixed item, team plan, and processing/authentication
   payment: none is voided automatically.
10. For the late-payment race, hold deletion delivery until its latest renewal is
    paid after cancellation. Confirm exactly one full refund, no paid access or
    usage reset, and offsetting revenue entries. Replay `invoice.paid` and refund
    deliveries: no additional refund or accounting entry. Repeat with a credited
    replacement subscription and with an existing partial refund: both require
    manual review and must not create another refund.

Measure recovered users/invoices within a fixed window after the first renewal
failure, joining by subscription and invoice. Separate card selection, actual
payment, and restored access; do not label a card update itself a recovery.
