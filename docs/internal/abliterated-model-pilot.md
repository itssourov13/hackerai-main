# Moderation-gated Abliteration pilot

Owner and rollout decisions: [HAC-99](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-99).
[Production readout dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/project/144137/dashboard/2070216).
The dashboard includes an assigned-model volume diagnostic
([insight gRZGMouh](https://us.posthog.com/project/144137/insights/gRZGMouh))
so base and Large v2 traffic can be checked independently.

## Paid first-step trial without moderation selection

[HAC-142](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-142) also owns the separate
`abliterated_paid_first_step_v2` trial. The original `v1` key belongs to a retired
experiment and must not be reused. Assignment happens before moderation, using
the authenticated paid user's stable identity. Explicit treatment skips the
moderation API and uses base `abliterated-model` on generation step 1, regardless
of selector or moderation score. Controls retain moderation and use the shipped moderated default: eligible
requests use base Abliteration on step 1; other requests use the selected baseline.
Unenrolled requests use that same moderated default. A missing flag, unknown variant,
lookup failure or missing provider credential never skips moderation.

Free requests, paid free-allowance rescue and unsupported file inputs remain
excluded. Entitlements, quotas, concurrency, sandbox access and tool approvals
retain their existing checks. Later steps and provider recovery use the saved
baseline. After an actual completed Abliteration step returns nonempty text or a
valid tool call, later baseline requests append the provider-only annotation to
the latest user message. This context survives retries and compaction within the
current run; it is not persisted as user authorization and never changes tool
permissions or approvals. Empty, rejected or failed attempts and baseline-only
vision routes do not activate it. Record the deployed continuation policy as a
separate experiment phase. This comparison measures the
combined model route and removal of the moderation call, not the isolated model
effect. Image preprocessing and bounded provider recovery remain shared with the
moderated route; auxiliary calls and subagents stay outside the trial.

Eligibility, exposure, provider and response outcomes use the new experiment key
and `selection_source=paid_first_step`. `moderation_checked=false` distinguishes
unclassified treatment from a checked request that did not meet the old threshold.
Successful new-trial responses cannot seed historical moderation continuity.
Use eligible assignments as the intention-to-treat denominator, including
requests that never serve output; exposure still requires actual provider output.
Natural completion requires success, stop, nonempty content and no step limit.
Keep absent outcomes and provider cost reports unknown rather than zero.

Repeated requests are clustered by authenticated user, and subscriber comparisons
use equal follow-up windows and immutable pre-entry billing periods. Report the
old cohort's crossover boundary when a user enters this trial; the older trial's
later retention can no longer be treated as exclusive exposure. Team seats share
a subscription and do not count as independent subscriber observations. The
historical Pro/Max task-feedback sampler does not cover this trial, so completion
alone is not evidence of usefulness. Keep sample-size planning, allocation,
review dates, rollback and cleanup decisions in HAC-142 and PostHog.

Preview and Production flags are separate. Deploy Vercel and Trigger independently
and verify each runtime's PostHog project before activation. Test a benign paid
Ask and Agent request in Preview, verify step-1 exposure with moderation unchecked,
and exercise a second generation to confirm the saved baseline. Check rendered
completion and reload persistence. Flag changes apply only to new requests/runs.

## Shipped moderation-selected paid default

[HAC-142](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-142) owns the shipped default.
All authorized paid Auto, Standard, Pro and Max requests in Ask and Agent that
qualify under the existing moderation decision use base `abliterated-model` on
generation step 1. Later steps and provider recovery retain the exact selected
baseline. Free users, allowance rescue, unsupported original attachments, missing
provider configuration and requests below the moderation routing threshold retain
the baseline. Analytics availability does not control this default.

The application no longer evaluates the retired `abliterated_max_moderated_v1`,
`abliterated_paid_moderated_v1` or continuity flags. Existing PostHog records remain
historical; their status and percentages do not describe new runtime routing.
New default routing uses attribution key `abliterated_paid_moderated_default_v1`,
which is not a feature flag or randomized cohort. Do not pool those observations
with the retired trial or label an all-treatment default a causal comparison.
Record Vercel and Trigger rollout boundaries separately, retain old assignments
for already-running requests, and account for crossover in subscriber follow-up.
The old Pro/Max feedback sampler does not cover this default or the new trial.

A default-route rollback needs a code revert and separate Vercel/Trigger releases;
changing a retired flag no longer reroutes requests. Deploy and verify Preview
and Production independently. Use deterministic moderation fixtures for gates,
and a disposable paid moderated Agent request to verify actual served step-1
output, saved baseline continuation, completion and reload persistence. Never
use customer content as a test fixture. Historical contracts below describe
retired pilots, not this shipped default.

## Free-user exclusion

Free-user Abliteration pilots are stopped. The shared assignment eligibility
check excludes `subscription=free` in both Ask and Agent before any flag lookup,
including requests with existing Abliteration chat history. Free users retain
their normal baseline models even if a retired flag is re-enabled.

In both Preview and Production, disable `abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1`
and remove the free-tier release condition from `abliterated_paid_moderated_v1`.
Keep paid targeting and rollout intact. Flag rollback applies to new requests
and runs; already-running work can retain its original assignment. Deploy the
shared code guard to Vercel and Trigger independently for permanent enforcement.

Historical events and PostHog experiment records remain available for readouts.
Analyze the original Ask and Agent cohorts separately, preserving assignment,
exposure, prior-payer exclusions and equal follow-up windows. Stopping enrollment
does not establish a statistical winner or remove historical data.

## Routing contract

Eligible paid requests in Ask and Agent may use an Abliteration model at
`https://api.abliteration.ai/v1`. Auto/Standard routes use `abliterated-model`;
explicit HackerAI Pro and Max routes use `abliterated-model-large-v2`. Ultra Ask
Auto also uses Large v2 because its current baseline is Pro, while Ultra Agent
Auto uses the base model because its baseline is Standard. The existing moderation
API normally selects the experiment through `shouldUncensorResponse=true`.
The separately flagged recent-chat preference below can retain the provider when
the new moderation score falls below the minimum routing threshold; it never
relaxes forbidden categories, upper score limits, tool approvals, or authorization.

Abliteration is limited to the first model-generation step within each
Ask response or Agent run. The shared AI SDK loop uses the assigned Abliteration
model for zero-based step index 0, then switches step 2 and every later step to
the request's saved OpenRouter baseline. The counter resets for each new response
or run; an Agent run can continue through its existing 500-step cap. Provider retry
attempts do not advance the completed-step counter. An Abliteration provider error
still disables the treatment route immediately for the replacement stream.

Because Large v2 is text-only, image attachments and image-view tool results use
the multimodal base `abliterated-model` for every selector, including Pro and Max.
PDFs, files without an image media type, and other unsupported file inputs retain
their original HackerAI route.

Requests with more than four provider-visible images use batched auxiliary
descriptions/OCR. Smaller requests keep native images unless Abliteration rejects
them before streaming with `media_dimensions_too_large` (413) or
`media_type_unsupported` (415). Those two rejections activate the same OCR path
and one retry on the selected Abliteration model. Original stored images remain
unchanged. Failed OCR is not restarted; moderation blocks, generic errors and
errors after streaming starts do not activate this recovery. Provider-attempt
telemetry retains the rejection and the subsequent outcome separately.

Explicit free-allowance rescue requests are excluded before assignment. Eligibility
is recorded before model-priced budget checks so cost-induced blocking cannot
silently remove treatment users from the denominator.

Paid daily free-allowance rescue requests and all free-tier requests are excluded.
Free Ask retains `ask-model-free-glm`; free Agent retains its selected baseline.
Existing quotas, concurrency checks and sandbox entitlements continue to apply.
The retired free Ask key `abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1`
([HAC-103](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-103)) is archived in PostHog and
removed from runtime analytics code. Free requests do not evaluate either
Abliteration flag.

Every control retains its exact existing baseline. Analyze provider model,
selector, subscription, input modality, and mode separately as well as overall.

`ABLITERATION_API_KEY` is a server credential. Missing credentials, missing flags,
unknown variants, and flag lookup errors preserve the existing route. Only an
explicit `test` assignment selects Abliteration. A `control` assignment preserves
the baseline model. Assignment uses the authenticated user ID, not a request ID.
Feature-flag evaluation does not emit an exposure event.

For the Abliteration treatment, provider-bound preparation does not append the
trusted platform-authorization annotation. Forged authorization tags are still
removed. Sandbox/resume reminders, saved notes, the normal system prompt, tools,
and the first Abliteration call retain their existing behavior. Later providers
receive the latest-message annotation after a completed Abliteration step, or
through the existing moderation decision. Recovery before any completed
Abliteration step retains the existing moderation-based preparation.

The provider uses the OpenAI-compatible AI SDK adapter, streaming usage, and native
default reasoning. OpenRouter options, routing lists, user attribution, and PDF
plugins are not sent to the direct endpoint. Existing bounded application retries
use the request's original baseline after an Abliteration failure. Subagents,
summaries, titles, and approval reviewers retain their existing models.

## Recent-chat continuity

`abliteration_chat_continuity_v1` retains Abliteration for paid parent-treatment
requests when at least two of the last five completed visible assistant responses
in the same chat independently used it. A completed response has `finish_reason=stop`;
a seed additionally requires a successfully finished Abliteration generation and
no response abort. Failed attempts, empty output, controls, fallback-only output,
and inherited selections never seed the preference. Two independently selected
responses are enough even when the chat has fewer than five completed responses.

The new input still runs through moderation. Missing credentials, API failures,
invalid scores, forbidden categories, and scores above the existing upper bound
fail closed. This preference only bypasses the lower routing threshold; it does
not set `platformAuthorized`. Existing plan, rescue, attachment, provider-fallback,
and one-generation-step restrictions apply. Regenerations do not inherit history.

Provenance is stored as `usage.abliterationRouting` (version, source, completed),
inside the existing flexible usage object, without a schema migration. The server
tracks successful Abliteration generation even when later steps use OpenRouter;
the final saved model alone is insufficient evidence. Client stop-save strips
this reserved field, and only the service-key save path can persist it. Legacy
responses without this marker are deliberately not seeds.

History metadata comes from the existing bounded backend page reads, separately
from model messages and before token truncation or summary projection. No full-chat
scan or extra database round trip is added. If bounded fetching reaches fewer than
five completed responses, only available evidence is used; missing evidence does
not count. As seeds leave the five-response window, inherited responses cannot
renew them.

Telemetry adds `selection_source` (`moderation` or `history`),
`independent_history_count`, and `routing_version=2` to the existing eligibility,
actual exposure, and provider outcome events. `moderation_eligible` reflects the
independent moderation decision. Compare completion, latency, estimated cost,
fallback/error/abort rates, and task feedback by routing source, mode and model.
History traffic is selected from prior treatment: it is not a randomized causal
comparison against parent controls. Churn and retention need a later user-level
readout with enough follow-up time. No user content is added to analytics.

Review Preview results before Production activation; initial review 2026-09-14.
Roll back via the continuity flag on completion/feedback regression, elevated
cost or latency, or any moderation/persistence failure. Remove the continuity
flag with the parent pilot after an explicit decision.

Definitions verified 2026-09-07:

| Environment | Project               | Flag   | Active | Rollout | Target                                                 |

| Preview     | hackerai-dev / 401167 | 870188 | Yes    | 100%    | Paid tiers; application also requires parent treatment |
| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 870186 | No     | 0%      | Paid tiers; no Production continuity activation        |

Both use `abliteration_chat_continuity_v1` and target `pro`, `pro-plus`, `ultra`,
and `team`. The parent flag remains unchanged. This implementation requires
Convex functions, Vercel and Trigger Preview deployments before end-to-end testing;
subsequent flag changes take effect on a new request/run.

Manual verification in the designated Preview branch: use a disposable paid chat,
complete two independently moderation-selected responses, then submit a benign
follow-up below the minimum routing score. Confirm `selection_source=history`,
completion and reload persistence, and OpenRouter on generation step two. Confirm
regeneration and an expired history window retain normal routing; check moderation
failure and forbidden-category exclusions with deterministic automated fixtures.
Do not seed routing markers by editing live user messages.

## Environment and rollout record

Flag definitions verified after the free-user rollback:

| Environment | PostHog project       | Flag ID | Key                               | State and targeting                                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 869145  | abliterated_paid_moderated_v1     | Active; paid tiers only; 100% treatment; paid internal override retained |
| Preview     | hackerai-dev / 401167 | 872124  | abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1 | Inactive; historical targeting and variants retained                     |
| Production  | HackerAI / 144137     | 872126  | abliterated_free_ask_moderated_v1 | Inactive; historical targeting and variants retained                     |

Paid groups target `subscription_tier` in `pro`, `pro-plus`, `ultra`, `team`.
The server supplies the current trusted subscription and enforces the remaining
eligibility checks. Only paid requests can evaluate the parent experiment flag.
Historical free Ask events retain their recorded key for analytics joins. Never
infer a runtime's environment from another service's configuration.

Before any deployment/configuration work, independently verify the intended
Convex account, project, designated deployment, URL, and custom domain, and the
checkout/CLI selecting them. Preview belongs only to HackerAI Developer's
designated Preview deployment; Production belongs only to HackerAI's designated
Production deployment. Resolve Vercel and Trigger independently. Do not copy local
Convex state or credentials between environments/checkouts.

Vercel and Trigger each need their own explicitly authorized environment setting
for `ABLITERATION_API_KEY`. Verify the worker's actual PostHog project key, not just
the Vercel setting. Local credential presence in both developer folders was checked;
remote credentials and runtime project selections remain unverified.

Routing-code changes need a new Vercel deployment and a new Trigger worker
deployment. A flag-only change is evaluated on the next Ask request or new Agent
run; it does not reroute an already-running stream.

## Event contract

All new server events carry `experiment_key`, `experiment_variant`,
`$feature/abliterated_paid_moderated_v1`, `experiment_request_id`, mode, tier,
and `generation_step_limit`. Provider-outcome events also
carry the one-based `generation_step` and `within_abliteration_step_limit`.
Eligibility identifies `assigned_platform_authorization_context`; each retained provider
outcome identifies its actual `platform_authorization_context` as `not_appended`
for an Abliteration model or `standard` for a control/fallback provider.
The request ID is the original assistant-message ID and stays stable across
provider retries. No new event contains prompts, answers, reasoning, targets,
tool names/arguments, files, raw provider errors, or credentials.

Telemetry v2 removes attempt events and successful continuation events. The
existing response-outcome event includes request-wide `provider_attempt_count`,
`provider_outcome_count`, `provider_pending_count`, per-outcome counts, requested
Abliteration/baseline attempt counts, continuation completion count, duration,
tool-call count, token/cache/reasoning totals, and `provider_estimated_cost_dollars`.
Counters remain stable across fallback message replacement and include retries;
they do not represent unique generation steps. `provider_usage_reported_count`
counts attempts with both input and output totals available for the cost estimate.
Missing usage is not an assertion of zero cost. These totals cover the wrapped
main response providers, not unwrapped subagents or image-summary helper calls.

Eligibility, actual exposure, first-step outcomes for both variants, exceptional
outcomes at every step, feedback, and final response outcomes remain unsampled.
A process terminated before final analytics may lose its in-memory summary; retain
eligible requests without a terminal event in the readout. No new per-step array
or user content is collected. Normal routing and billing are unchanged.

For charts, do not use the remaining provider-outcome event count as the total
call denominator. Use sums of v2 response totals, deduplicated by
`experiment_request_id`. For first-step quality/latency, filter
`generation_step=1` for both telemetry versions. Historical spend uses v1
provider-outcome cost; v2 spend uses response-summary cost. Never add v2 detailed
outcome cost to v2 summary cost, which would double-count first steps and errors.
The provider-failure chart remains compatible because all exceptional outcomes
are retained. A drop in diagnostic events at deployment is intentional.

Exposure means content entered the application stream, not confirmed browser
delivery or task usefulness. Reasoning-only output does not count. A completed
tool-call step does not establish that the overall request succeeded.

Existing `hackerai-usage_cost`, usage settlement, and Agent outcome events retain
the assigned variant even after fallback. Existing `message_feedback_submitted`
joins through `message_id`; use eligible/exposure/message-link events to resolve
replacement message IDs. Billing and later activity join by authenticated
`distinct_id`, without re-evaluating the flag at cancellation time.

## Readout protocol

The one-step phase emits `generation_step_limit=1` on eligibility and provider
events; the earlier three-step phase emitted `3`. Scope each readout by that
property on deduplicated eligible requests, then link all outcomes by
`experiment_request_id`. Compare control/test within the same phase, and do not
pool phases or treat before/after changes as randomized evidence. Production
activation starts with the first verified one-step run, not the Git merge time.

1. Freeze the rollout definition and record the first production exposure date.
   Compare randomized control/test users only. Do not compare treatment with all
   unassigned users. Exclude internal tests and report any assignment crossover.
2. Deduplicate `(distinct_id, experiment_request_id)` from eligible events.
   Left-join final response outcomes and the final provider-call outcome. Missing
   terminal events remain in the denominator and are reported as unknown/failure,
   never silently removed. Primary success requires application success and a
   nonempty final answer; tool-only completion is not sufficient.
3. Report successful nonempty responses per eligible request, absolute differences
   and uncertainty with user-level clustering. Also report unique exposed users,
   eligible requests, mode/tier composition, and per-user request counts. The
   dashboard's raw event counts and per-call metrics are diagnostics, not substitutes
   for the deduplicated primary analysis.
4. Compare linked positive/negative feedback, feedback participation, regeneration,
   Stop, latency, empty/truncated answers, fallback and error rates. Feedback is
   self-selected; nonempty answers are not proof of usefulness. User-level funnel
   charts intentionally include later actions on other models; link messages for
   response-specific conclusions.
5. Sum per-attempt estimated provider spend before dividing by successful eligible
   requests. Failed legs may be refunded/discarded from customer billing; billed
   cost alone understates provider spend. Calls without reported usage have unknown
   cost, not zero. Reconcile with provider billing before expanding. Also compare
   existing billed usage, budget exhaustion and usage-limit pressure.
6. Anchor retention at the user's first eligible request. D1/D7/D30 activity means
   later `hackerai-usage_cost` activity in either Ask or Agent, regardless of model.
   Compare only fully observed 24-hour windows. Do not count recent, immature users
   as churned. Keep monthly/yearly plans and prior tenure separate in the final readout.
7. Measure cancellation intent with `cancellation_completed`; actual subscription
   loss with `subscription_cancelled`. Exclude `retention_pause=true`, separate
   voluntary/involuntary churn, and remove pre-existing cancellation intent from
   incident-churn analysis. Track `subscription_changed`, pause/reversal, and payment
   recovery separately. Use unique at-risk users as denominator, not message counts.
   Dashboard churn funnels are provisional until cohorts mature; renewals may need
   a longer window than D30, especially annual plans.

Operational review: seven days after launch. Retention review: matured D7 and D30
cohorts. Never claim a churn improvement from a small early sample or a nonsignificant
result. No automatic rollout ramp. The owner must record the readout in HAC-99.

Disable the flag on any safety/authorization regression or repeated provider
failures. Investigate >2 percentage points of added failures, >25% p95 latency
regression, or >25% cost-per-success regression; do not wait for statistical
significance during an incident. Final rollout decisions must weigh quality gains
against additional cost. Remove the flag and losing provider path after the final
decision, targeting cleanup within 60 days of launch.

## Model routing measurement

For outcomes with `model_routing_telemetry_version = 1`, `fallback_served` requires
text or a tool call from a recovery call using a different requested model, or a
reported response model in the call's configured upstream fallback list. Planned
baseline steps and vision selection alone do not establish a fallback. The old
final-model flag is retained as `legacy_fallback_served` for comparison. Historical
events without this version must not be interpreted using the corrected definition.

Use `planned_baseline_attempt_count` and `vision_route_attempt_count` for routing
volume. Use `abliterated_provider_error_count` and `baseline_provider_error_count`
for provider errors, with their respective provider attempt counts as denominators.
Use `provider_error_recovery_attempt_count` and `provider_error_recovery_served`
for retries after errors, including retries on the same model;
`provider_error_fallback_served` additionally requires a model change. Empty,
truncated, filtered, and incomplete outputs initiate a separate output recovery
chain, measured by `output_recovery_attempt_count` and
`output_recovery_fallback_served`. The initiating reason persists across failed
retry legs until completion or cancellation. A failure without a subsequent call
is not a recovery attempt, and reasoning alone does not count as served content.

These bounded summaries accompany `abliterated_model_response_outcome` and, for
Agent mode, `hackerai-agent_run`; they retain the original experiment assignment
and contain no user content. `upstream_model_fallback_served` relies on the
provider reporting a configured alternate model; unreported upstream routing
cannot be inferred. Keep provider error rates separate from request-level fallback
and successful task completion rates.

## Verification

Run the bounded live provider test from this checkout:

```sh
corepack pnpm exec tsx scripts/test-abliteration.ts
corepack pnpm exec tsx scripts/test-abliteration.ts --large-v2
```

It loads only the provider credential, uses synthetic arithmetic and an in-memory
tool, exercises the registered provider plus tool IDs and telemetry, caps output
and duration, and does not ingest PostHog events. It is not full app verification.

For release verification on the verified Preview custom URL:

1. Use a disposable paid-user Ask chat and an eligible synthetic authorized lab
   request. Confirm moderation eligibility, streaming completion, model attribution,
   one exposure, and reload persistence. Repeat in Agent with one bounded tool call.
2. Confirm benign/unflagged requests, prohibited-category moderation results,
   moderation failure, PDFs, other unsupported files, and free-allowance
   rescue keep their baseline routes. Confirm image requests use the base Abliteration
   model for Standard, Pro, and Max while text-only Pro/Max requests use Large v2.
   Unit tests cover deterministic gates; use approved synthetic fixtures for
   integration testing rather than customer content.
   In Direct Ask and Agent, force one response/run through at least three sequential
   model-generation steps. Confirm step 1 uses the assigned Abliteration route and
   step 2 onward uses the exact OpenRouter baseline without flag re-evaluation. Start
   a new response/run and confirm its generation-step counter starts again at one.
3. Force the flag off/control and a provider outage. Verify fallback completes,
   assignment stays unchanged in outcomes/costs, replacement messages can be rated,
   and no duplicate tool action occurs.
4. Stop, regenerate, rate, reload, and reconnect the disposable response. Confirm
   message linkage, terminal outcomes, token/cost attribution, and no content in
   analytics. Clean up the test chats. Repeat the bounded journey on the production
   custom domain for the explicit test-user override and sampled treatment cohort
   before any further rollout expansion.

## Free-user rollback verification

Use a disposable free Ask chat and a free Agent chat with a connected local
sandbox. Submit a bounded synthetic request that previously qualified for
Abliteration. Verify completion, reload persistence and the normal free baseline;
verify there is no new Abliteration assignment or exposure. Repeat with an
existing chat that contains Abliteration history. Check the designated Preview
URL and production custom domain independently after the Vercel and Trigger
code deployments. Verify one eligible paid request still uses treatment.

Historical free Agent decisions and cohort boundaries remain in HAC-99; free Ask
records remain in HAC-103. The paid pilot and its temporary feedback workflow
continue. Full temporary survey cleanup is governed separately by HAC-101.
