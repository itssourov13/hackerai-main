# MIOSA fresh-workspace Pro and Pro+ pilot

Owner and rollout/readout decisions: [HAC-78](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-78/rollout-miosa-as-primary-cloud-agent-sandbox-with-e2b-fallback).

## Pause and recovery

MIOSA cloud execution and E2B-to-MIOSA migration are paused in code for all
environments. New cloud acquisitions use E2B even when an environment override
or rollout flag requests MIOSA. Keep both rollout and migration flags inactive
in each PostHog project. Existing active runs on older workers may finish;
the code guard requires deploying both web and Trigger workers.

Migration-blocked users and cached MIOSA clients use a fresh, isolated E2B
workspace while paused. The exact fallback sandbox is pinned; the old routing
record is retained in `recoveryPending` and original files are not modified.
Old files require separate recovery and are not present in the fresh workspace.
Never reconnect the stale E2B source or overwrite new fallback files with a
recovery copy. Cleanup still needs both providers' credentials.

Resuming requires a reviewed change to `isMiosaCloudSandboxPaused`, independent
environment verification and the acceptance checks below before reactivating
either project's flags. The remaining pilot instructions describe that future
resumption, not the current routing behavior.

## Approved scope

Live activation state and dated acceptance evidence belong in HAC-78 and the
two PostHog projects, not this runbook. Before activation, require passing
streaming, file integrity, pause/resume (including long-paused disk restore),
destroyed-name reuse, and a real Preview Agent plus reconnect. Passing a fresh
creation test alone is insufficient. Follow the release order below before
enrolling Production users.

- Candidate percentages are managed in HAC-78 and the two PostHog projects.
- New enrollment: authenticated Pro or Pro+ Cloud Agent users, outside Europe,
  with no running or paused E2B workspace in any configured E2B account/cluster.
- No activity event, an idle sandbox, or an old template is **not** proof that
  a workspace has terminated. Read E2B state directly, including all templates.
- Do not delete, pause, migrate, or reset a workspace to make a user eligible.
- The separately controlled [file-preserving migration](miosa-workspace-migration.md)
  may enroll an existing workspace only after verified transfer and cutover.
  Its retained source, routing fence and rollback rules override fresh enrollment
  for that cohort; workspaces with files remain on E2B.
- Retain E2B fallback and existing region, authorization, and paid-plan gates.
- Deployed parent/subagent runs must confirm actual Trigger placement matches
  the requested region before content loading and provider selection. Missing
  or mismatched placement fails closed, including requests for US execution.

## How it works

`selectCloudSandboxProvider` evaluates the stable user ID, execution environment,
and server-resolved `subscription_tier`. The flag samples candidates; it is not
the authorization or workspace-preservation boundary.

At actual acquisition, an already connected E2B workspace stays on E2B. MIOSA
checks its canonical per-user name before attempting new enrollment. An existing
MIOSA record follows the normal reuse/resume path; the pilot does not erase it
because of an old E2B fallback workspace or a subsequent plan upgrade.

Only a confirmed MIOSA not-found result invokes the new-workspace guard:

1. Require the `pro` or `pro-plus` plan. Missing plan, Free, Ultra, and Team do
   not create a new MIOSA workspace under this pilot.
2. Require the configured default E2B account so missing credentials cannot be
   mistaken for an empty inventory.
3. Query running and paused E2B workspaces by user metadata, without a template
   filter. Check every configured cluster; this is metadata-only discovery, not
   cross-region command execution. Any existing record vetoes enrollment.
4. On missing credentials, failed reads, timeout, or incomplete pagination, stay
   on E2B. Only confirmed absence permits MIOSA's normal idempotent create.

The API inventory is a point-in-time check, not a cross-provider transaction.
Keep assignment stable and do not change provider settings while a user's Agent
run is active. E2B fallback does not copy files or rescue every mid-run failure.

## Flag configuration and release order

Key: `miosa_cloud_sandbox_rollout_v1` in both independent projects:

| Environment         | Project               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Preview/development | hackerai-dev `401167` |
| Production          | HackerAI `144137`     |

Filter by the matching `hackerai_environment`; the server enforces Pro and Pro+
eligibility only for new enrollment. Do not add a changing plan condition that
inadvertently evicts an existing MIOSA assignment after a paid-plan upgrade.
Keep the flag key and distinct ID stable. An explicit E2B override remains an
emergency rollback.

These are approved targets, **not evidence that Production is enabled**. Before
activation, merge reviewed code, independently verify Vercel/Trigger/Convex and
PostHog identities, deploy both runtimes, and pass an internal Production smoke
test. Read back each flag and its actual execution environment. Never copy
Preview's percentage or credentials into Production.

## Measurement and rollback

`miosa_cloud_sandbox_enrollment_denied` reports a bounded reason (`not_pro`,
`existing_e2b_workspace`, or `workspace_discovery_unavailable`). A denied candidate
does not emit MIOSA rollout exposure, acquisition failure, or provider fallback.
Real MIOSA acquisition failures retain existing failure/fallback telemetry.

Keep candidate assignment, enrollment, exposure and final provider distinct.
Do not use `$feature_flag_called` alone as actual MIOSA exposure. Compare
completion, latency and cost against comparable fresh Pro and Pro+ E2B workspaces, not
the unfiltered E2B population with older workspaces. Include retry and fallback
costs; testing credits are not production economics.

Review after at least 48 hours and 100 completed eligible runs (extend the window
for low traffic). Stop expansion for data loss, restore/cancellation/output
failures, or material reliability, latency or cost regression. No automatic ramp.

## Verification

- Pro or Pro+ + confirmed empty E2B inventory: may create MIOSA when assigned
  treatment.
- Pro or Pro+ + running/paused E2B (including old templates/later pages/other
  configured cluster): remains E2B; no workspace is deleted by the enrollment
  guard.
- Free, Ultra, or Team + no MIOSA record: no new MIOSA enrollment.
- Existing MIOSA assignment: reuse/resume without applying the new-user gate.
- Failed inventory lookup: E2B; never interpret the failure as an empty list.
- After eligible Preview/Production Agent completion, verify final provider,
  delayed stdout/stderr and exit status, files, PTY, and a follow-up reconnect.
