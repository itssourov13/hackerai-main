# Existing E2B workspace migration

Owner and rollout: [HAC-113](https://linear.app/hackerai/issue/HAC-113).

Migration is currently paused in code in all environments. Scheduling and worker
flag rechecks return disabled regardless of PostHog targeting. Keep the migration
flag inactive in both projects. Users blocked by a migration receive a fresh,
isolated E2B workspace so Agent execution can continue. The routing record pins
that exact E2B sandbox and retains the complete previous fence in
`recoveryPending`; original workspaces and staged archives are not modified.
Previous files are not available in this fresh workspace until separately
recovered. Do not overwrite the new workspace during recovery: it may already
contain new user work. Reset and account-deletion fences never permit fallback.
The procedures below apply only after reviewed resumption of the rollout.

This replaces pristine-template fingerprinting. No baseline JSON is required.
The migration copies only `/home/user`, including hidden files and metadata.
It does not distinguish Agent-created files from other files in that directory.
The original E2B sandbox is retained. Files outside `/home/user`, installed system
tools and running processes are not migrated; customized runtimes may need
reinstalling. Do not describe this as preserving an arbitrary VM unchanged.

## Eligibility and storage contract

The existing paid-plan and Miosa assignment gates still apply. A server request
selected by `miosa_e2b_file_migration_v1` nominates only the E2B workspace used
by that recent acquisition, schedules a Trigger task after 20 minutes and
continues using E2B. There is no all-user scanner. Scheduling is deduplicated per
user/source across all parent Agent runs using a global Trigger idempotency key
for twelve hours. This covers the configured delay, attempts, idle waits and
backoff; the durable fence remains authoritative if a later job is scheduled. If that recent workspace is still active or holds the
activity fence, the same task waits 15 minutes and rechecks it up to three times;
permanent incompatibilities complete without another attempt. The worker
rechecks the flag, complete cross-cluster inventory, source ownership, paused
lifecycle, region and the exclusive 15-minute activity fence. Source
metadata must match the worker's configured E2B template alias because multiple
environments may share an E2B account. Unknown or other-environment sources are
deferred even if their user ID matches. Multiple
sources, attached volumes, EU/unknown execution, existing Miosa workspaces,
active commands, unsupported mounts, unsupported home entries and links from
home to un-restored paths are deferred. The destination must use the native
`hackerai-tools` template.

The archive includes regular files, hidden/empty files, directories, internal
links, numeric ownership, modes, extended attributes and tar timestamps under
`/home/user`. Sockets, device nodes, FIFOs and links to outside-home paths defer
migration. System files and runtime logs outside home are not scanned or copied.
Unknown reads and detected source changes deny cutover. The original source
remains the recovery copy for files and runtime state outside the migration scope.

Initial limits: 250,000 entries, 12 GiB of regular-file data and a 4 GiB compressed
archive. Archive bytes pass through the worker in 4 MiB chunks without local
disk, object storage or content-bearing task payloads. The worker checks total
size and SHA-256; the destination rechecks archive integrity and the restored
home's content/metadata fingerprint. It verifies the source again, pauses it,
and tests destination pause/resume persistence before committing the destination
ID. Oversized workspaces and insufficient destination storage stay on E2B.
Two jobs may run concurrently. Tasks have a two-hour ceiling and up to three
attempts with backoff; transient E2B connection and command-list checks also get
three bounded attempts with operation-specific diagnostics before the task
fails. Individual filesystem operations and transfers have shorter limits. A
retained checking fence records its owning Trigger run and attempt. A duplicate
waits while that exact attempt is executing. A retry, legacy ownerless record,
terminal owner or unavailable status requires recovery; no fence is expired or
automatically cleared.

## Cutover and recovery

Keep the durable Redis fence and deploy fence-aware Ask/Agent workers before
activation. A request blocked by a checking fence or reverse-recovery fence,
or by a committed MIOSA workspace while MIOSA is paused, creates a fresh E2B
workspace without discovering or connecting any recovery copy. An atomic
compare-and-set replaces only the observed routing record, preserving it in
`recoveryPending`. A concurrent request reconnects to the winning pin; an older
migration job loses its ownership and cannot replace the new route. An unknown
Redis write outcome retains the newly created sandbox for reconciliation.
Account cleanup/deletion and unreadable Redis records still block acquisitions.

Prepared destinations use private, unique migration names, not the normal
workspace name. Failed copies destroy only that prepared destination and remove
their own source staging directory before releasing the fence. Unconfirmed
cleanup, process death or uncertain commit retains the fence for operator
recovery. Never bulk-clear migration records or give them a TTL.

Committed records pin an exact destination ID. Missing or broken E2B destinations
fail safely; fallback never resumes the stale E2B copy. MIOSA acquisition failures
with a migration record use the same fresh E2B fallback described above. Flag
rollback stops new migrations, including in-flight copies before installation.
Legacy committed
empty-migration records remain readable. Cleanup atomically owns the same Redis
key before enumerating either provider, including when no migration existed.
An active checking claim blocks cleanup before enumeration; never revoke it to
force deletion. Concurrent cleanup attempts must retry.

Explicit workspace reset deletes both providers, then clears only its matching
cleanup token. Failed reset restores the prior committed record so it cannot
expose the retained E2B copy. Account deletion retains a non-expiring `deleted`
fence even after partial provider failure, preventing delayed migration jobs
from creating another destination. Failed deletion retains any committed pin so
retries still require both providers; account deletion may retry cleanup under
that fence. Never clear a deleted account's fence to retry a task.

A crashed cleanup retains `cleanup` ownership and any prior committed record
inside it. Stop the cleanup invocation and confirm it cannot resume before
operator recovery. For reset, finish provider deletion or restore the recorded
committed pin; clear the matching cleanup token only after complete deletion.
For account deletion, finish provider cleanup and retain the `deleted` fence.

For a stranded checking record, stop the corresponding Trigger job, confirm the
record token/source and both provider identities, destroy the exact uncommitted
prepared destination and remove the owned source staging directory. Verify no
commit occurred before clearing that exact checking record. A committed or
uncertain migration requires Miosa recovery or a separately verified reverse
transfer. Source retention has no automatic deletion job; establish a retention
policy separately before deleting any retained E2B workspace.

## Rollout and acceptance

PostHog Preview project 401167 uses the independent migration key at 100% for
`hackerai_environment=preview|development`; Production project 144137 starts at
25% for `hackerai_environment=production`, default 0%. Bucketing uses the stable
user ID. Prepare both flags disabled until acceptance. Disable the superseded
empty-migration flag; its baseline tool/configuration is removed.

Before activation, independently verify Vercel, Trigger, PostHog and the proper
Convex account/deployment for each environment. A Vercel Preview URL alone does
not prove the Trigger worker uses Preview configuration. Deploy the new task and
acquisition code, finish older cohort runs, then enable Preview acceptance.
After acceptance, enable the authorized production 25%; increasing it requires
a separate readout and rollout decision. Flag changes affect new acquisitions
and in-flight pre-cutover checks without another deployment.

On the actual Preview URL using disposable paid test accounts:

1. Create an E2B workspace with binary, hidden and empty files, nested folders,
   permissions, internal links and xattrs. Include a disposable file outside home.
   Run a bounded Agent command, allow the idle interval, and run the migration
   task. Verify copied home contents and that the outside-home file is not copied.
2. Run Agent on Miosa, reload/reconnect and verify the files again. Confirm the
   old E2B ID still exists. Check both the visible response and actual provider.
3. Verify active work, mounted volumes, multiple sources, outside-home links,
   unknown reads and size limits defer migration without changing the source.
4. Nominate the same source from two separate Agent runs and confirm they share
   one delayed migration run. For a deliberately duplicated disposable test job,
   verify `migration_in_progress` while the owner executes and `already_claimed`
   after it commits. A crashed owner must still require recovery.
5. Exercise corrupted transfer, source changes, interrupted workers, failed
   destination cleanup, lost commit acknowledgement and destination loss. Confirm
   no partial destination or stale E2B copy becomes available.
6. Create a Miosa-only file, disable the flag and simulate acquisition failure.
   Verify a fresh E2B fallback is pinned, both original copies remain untouched,
   and reconnect uses the fallback rather than either original. Verify explicit reset.

`miosa_e2b_file_migration_checked` reports bounded reason/count/duration fields;
`miosa_e2b_file_migration_exposed` records actual acquisition after cutover.
Neither event contains paths, hashes, filenames, contents or credentials.
Track completed Agent runs after exposure, preservation/reconnect failures,
user interruption, transfer cost and acquisition latency. Ross reviews after
48 hours and at least 100 completed affected runs; low traffic extends review.
Stop new migrations on any integrity/isolation failure or material reliability
regression. Remove the flag only after cohort completion and a stable readout.
